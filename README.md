## Challenges:
- The only challenge I experienced is time. There were a lot of videos to code along with.

## Feedback:
- This project was very considering the fact that I was coding along with Scrimba videos, but I benefited because I learned a lot, including different ways of doing the same thing. Which is great because I get to choose my own way to code some things based on how I want it to work.
